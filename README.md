- **Four Character Types🔤**:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - 🔢Numbers (0-9)
  - ⚡Special symbols (!@#$%^&*() etc.)
- **🔄Random Shuffling**: Characters are randomly shuffled to ensure unpredictability
- **⚙️User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive prompts with emoji for better user experience
- **⛓️Security Focused**: Generates truly random passwords for enhanced security

## 🔧 How It Works

1. *Character Sets*: The program defines four character sets:
   - 26 lowercase letters (a-z)
   - 26 uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - 10 digits (0-9)
   - 27 special symbols

2. *Password Generation Process*:
   - Collects user input for each character type
   - Randomly selects characters from each specified set
   - Combines all selected characters into a list
   - Shuffles the combined list for randomness
   - Joins the characters into a final password string

3. *Security Features*:
   - Uses Python's random module for randomization
   - Ensures at least one character from each requested type
   - Random shuffling prevents predictable patterns
